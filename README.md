# OneLife
A version of OHOL supporting multibyte characters and other useful modifications like fov  scaling, quick key for emotion and type. And a server support several useful commands.
This repositorya is merged from branch by Awbz and Jason, thanks for their work.


also need to checkout modificated minorGems library in here:
https://github.com/cnwillz/minorGems
in which there is some code for showing multibyte characters.
You can also directly locate file at:
minorGems\game\Font.h
minorGems\game\Font.cpp
and check for differences.


**NOTE**:  This mod is no longer being actively developed, meaning that it's likely that new features won't be added.  However, I will continue updating the current mod packages to stay current with Jason's revisions.  Meanwhile, if you seek additional features, be sure to check out these fantastic mods:

***IMPORTANT NOTE FOR MAC USERS:*** Jason has officially dropped support for macOS, so the installation is slightly different as there are no longer auto-updates.  This macOS release is now a full client, compiled for 64-bit, and the entire OneLife_v### directory within the macOS zip file should be copied into your Applications folder.

Now just launch the game with OneLife+.exe for Windows, OneLife_v###+.app on macOS (where ### is the client version), or OneLife+ on Linux.
